## Action #3 
> &nbsp;&nbsp; Only one specific reality is being concealed from Israelis: the 
 reality of Gaza. Life and death in this stricken land is not covered 
 in the newspapers, and it's not on TV. **There's almost no coverage 
 of Gaza**, except in the pages of Haaretz and on some dissident websites. The children dying on the muddied, bloodstained 
 floors of the hospitals of Gaza; the hundreds of thousands of 
 uprooted individuals who must run for their lives from one place 
 to another, with nowhere to hide; the tens of thousands of dead 
 and wounded; the complete obliteration of entire sections of the 
 Strip; the indiscriminate killing, the blind shelling and bombing 
 as well as the shooting by snipers of innocent people who are 
 waving white flags; and also, the hungry, the thirsty and the sick. 
 The forlorn tent cities as winter approached. The children who 
 barely survived on contaminated water and a lone piece of bread 
 each day. The elderly who were driven from place to place, riding 
 on the backs of halting donkey-drawn wagons from the north 
 of the Strip to the south. The dead bodies left abandoned in the 
 streets. **This is a humanitarian disaster of enormous proportions, 
 and it is not covered in Israel. Almost at all.** Occasionally there 
 will be a laconic report, mainly of statistics, little more than lip 
 service offered out of obligation, without any professional sense 
 of proportion indicating that in Gaza there is a human disaster 
 transpiring that is almost beyond description, and that the people 
 living there are in fact human beings. 
 > &nbsp;&nbsp; Israel's media have acted this way for years. They conceal the 
 occupation and whitewash its crimes. No one orders them to 
 do this; it is done willingly, out of the understanding that this is 
 what their consumers want to hear. For the commercial media, 
 that is the top and foremost consideration.

#### Further extract(s)

> &nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday, the body of 6-year-old Hind Hamada—or Rajab, 
 in some news outlets—was found. **The girl had become famous 
 all over the world after the moments of terror she and her family** 
 experienced on January 29 in the face of Israeli tanks—moments 
 that were recorded in a phone call with the Palestinian Red Crescent, until her aunt's screams of terror stopped. Seven members of 
 the family were killed; only the fate of little Hind had remained 
 a mystery.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp; Hind was found dead in her aunt's burned car at a gas station 
 in Khan Yunis. She had been wounded, covered by the seven 
 bodies of her relatives, and **she bled to death before she could 
 extricate herself from the vehicle**. Hind and her family had 
 responded to Israel's "humanitarian" call to evacuate. Anyone 
 who wants thousands more Hinds should invade Rafah, whose 
 population will be evacuated to Al-Mawasi.
