## Action #2

### Do it at home, become an ace 2lb. pamphleteer 

Cut out the middleperson when you can.

If you have an Amazon account, you can participate directly in the Action! 

Just browse the book and add it to your Cart. (Any format, used or new, doesn't matter) -

https://amazon.com/dp/019769571X

When you checkout, you will add a **new Shipping Address**. 

The easiest way to get an address is with [this chatGPT query](https://chatgpt.com/?model=gpt-4o&q=Random%20list%20LDS%20Mormon%20chapels%20in%20Georgia%20state)

Or you can **manually query** your preferred GPT

` Random list LDS Mormon chapels in Georgia state
`

Pick ad lib a particular church.  For the addressee, use a directory, or go with a generic choice like *Accounting* or *Treasurer*. 

Then place the order! 

Remember ... packing slips contain no personal info -- just the order ID.

## Tell everyone about the order

Use the shareblock! - Just click, then paste into new post, email, message
<textarea style="resize:none;overflow:hidden;user-select:all;" readonly wrap=off rows=3 cols=37
