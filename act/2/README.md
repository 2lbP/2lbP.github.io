## Action #2 
> Never was this more acutely felt than in 2018 when an insensitive prankster, pretending to be a church PR spokesperson, devised a faux statement on LDS church letterhead with the catchy headline **"President Nelson  Meets with NAACP; Offers Apology for History of Racism."**  

>>> We have previously acknowledged that the false and racist explanations for the Priesthood and Temple restriction were wrong and disavowed them. Today, I  am declaring that the ban itself was wrong. It was not of God but of fallible men, born of ignorance, pride and sin....  
>> &nbsp;&nbsp; On behalf of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, its current and past leaders and members, I offer this humble apology and plead for forgiveness in the merciful name of Jesus Christ, Amen.   

> Scores of Black Latter-day Saints praised the statement, and when they learned that it was a hoax, they were hurt "and in some cases traumatized by it." **"I've spoken to black folks in tears because they thought this was real,"** commented Harvard graduate student Janan Graham-Russell, a Latter-day Saint of Black Haitian descent. Another Black Latter-day Saint, Zandra Vranes, "posted a tearful, 83-minute video on Facebook about how the hoax had retraumatized black members of the church." "May God have mercy on your soul," she told the prankster, a White disaffected Latter-day Saint named Jonathan Streeter.

Historians should tell only that part of the truth that is inspiring and uplifting."

#### Further extract(s)

> Rather, Kimball, his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles, "thrashed out, discussed, and re-discussed" the church's race doctrine until they reached a consensus that it needed to be changed. Then, after a prolonged period of debate and discussion, punctuated with prayer, church leaders concluded that it was time to admit Black people into their ranks as full, functioning members. 

> That Kimball achieved a revelation to lift the ban was nothing short of extraordinary given the **hard-liners' deeply held prejudices**. Yet his revelation â€” known in the Mormon canon as "Official Declaration 2" â€” provided more questions than answers. The revelation lifted the ban, but it didn't address the doctrine that had sustained it. This oversight proved catastrophic for the postrevelation church as Latter-day Saints continued to **teach that Black people bore a divine curse**.

#### About the book 

>  It was the most significant change in LDS doctrine since the end of polygamy almost 100 years earlier. Â¶ Drawing on never-before-seen private papers of LDS apostles and church presidents, including Spencer W. Kimball, Matthew L. Harris probes the plot twists and turns, the near-misses and paths not taken, of this incredible story. While the notion that Kimball received a revelation might imply a sudden command from God, Harris shows that a variety of factors motivated Kimball and other church leaders to reconsider the ban, including the civil rights movement, which placed LDS racial policies and practices under a glaring spotlight, perceptions of racism that dogged the church and its leaders, and Kimball's own growing sense that the ban was morally wrong. Â¶ Harris also shows that the lifting of the ban was hardly a panacea. The church's failure to confront and condemn its racial theology in the decades after the 1978 revelation stifled their efforts to reach Black communities and made Black members the target of racism in LDS meetinghouses. Vigilant members pestered church leaders to repudiate their anti-Black theology, forcing them to live up to the creed in Mormon scripture that "all are alike unto God." Deeply informed, engagingly written, and grounded in deep archival research, Harris provides a compelling and detailed account of how Mormon leaders lifted the priesthood and temple ban, then came to reckon with the church's controversial racial heritage.
