## Cognitive Dissonance f.t.w. 

We promote and conduct different "Actions" based on a particular Book with unimpeachable credentials and reputation. 

*"The right book can change your life!"*  When birds of a feather flock together, they read from the same page. Only an outsider can place amidst the flock something new. 

Help us help the flock to change.  **Send the Book** directly yourself; or **donate** so we can order them. 

<!-- * Help us help them receive that Book. 
* One aim is, reminding Insiders that we outsiders can effortlessly peer into their organization ; (disinfect sunlight; shunyata) ; System's self inoculation , immune proactive ; proactive lying 
* MLK, hated in his time ; "most hated" man in America

## We are all NOT thinking of a pink elephant

Can delivering 30 or 40 hardcovers *really* make an impact??

> The [Streisand] effect is named for American singer and actress Barbra Streisand, whose attorney attempted to suppress the publication of a photograph showing her clifftop residence in Malibu ... inadvertently drawing far greater attention to the previously obscure photograph. The effect exemplifies psychological reactance, in which the **attempt to hide information instead makes it more interesting to seek out and propagate**.

With each Book, the aim is to raise awareness ... provoke discussion ... stoke cognitive dissonance.  <!-- The World is ending right now; what are you doing about it? --> Before changing, people must (at a minimum) feel discomfort.  Each action's secondary aim is Triggering-via-Truth on a public stage. 

<!-- Suffering exists? Whose suffering?; who suffers more? How is it caused? 
Orwell, anything else just PR ; quote 

“Whatever a patron desires to get published is advertising; whatever he wants to keep out of the paper is news,” ... placard on the desk of L. E. Edwardson, day city editor of the Chicago Herald and Examiner.

Online disinformation is pervasive, yet also **ephemeral**.  The Word (the Book) is Forever; also publicly visible.

> ... revelation lifting the church's 126-year-old ban barring Black people from the priesthood and Mormon temples. It was the most significant change in LDS doctrine since the end of polygamy almost 100 years earlier.

> ... placed LDS racial policies and practices under a glaring spotlight, perceptions of racism that dogged the church and its leaders, and Kimball's own growing sense that the ban was morally wrong.

> Harris also shows that the lifting of the ban was hardly a panacea. The church's failure to confront and condemn its racial theology in the decades after the 1978 revelation stifled their efforts to re

Toni Morrison said,
"Goodness is... more interesting, more complicated, more demanding, less predictable, more adventuresome than its opposite. Evil really is boring. Sensational, perhaps, but not interesting. A low-level activity..."

“There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always— do not forget this, Winston— always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless.

If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever.”
